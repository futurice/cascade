/**
 * This can be useful for referring in a lambda expression to the the lambda expression.
 * <p>
 * This can also be useful for removing all references to an intermediate from such that is may be
 * garbage collected if needed. Intermediate values in a active chain may be consuming
 * a lot of memory. In asynchronous functional chains based on RunnableAltFuture, dereference of
 * intermediate values when going on to the next function, but only in production builds.
 * <p>
 * Note that there is no mutator method which allows to re-enter the initial {@link SettableAltFuture#ZEN}
 * state once it is lost. Thus one can not abuse the system to make an immutable mutable by moving back
 * through this intermediate state. Once you leave the temple, you can never go back.
 * <p>
 * Note that <code>null</code> is not a permissible from
 * <p>
 * This uses a free thread model (any calling thread is used for all chained functions). This is a
 * main difference from the similar {@link com.futurice.cascade.functional.SettableAltFuture} which forces
 * the specified evaluation thread group.
